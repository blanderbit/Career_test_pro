However, one should also take into account the fact that people themselves influence their professional environment, which means they can also find satisfaction in a profession that appealed less to them initially. It is therefore wise to also review and analyze professional occupations that may not directly match your personal three-letter code but have similarities and personal characteristics in common."		1	"2019-04-01 12:54:16"	"2019-04-01 12:54:16"

210	210	"Based on the six different personality types, this report has given you insight into your personality profile. To each personality profile certain occupations and activities fit to a greater or lesser extent. This is why career tests in general are not actually tests that give a specific answer to the question: what should I be?"		1	"2019-04-01 12:54:19"	"2019-04-01 12:54:19"
211	211	"Instead the career test and the resulting personality profile provide a substantiation why certain occupations suit you better than others. These test results can help you make better decisions with regard to your (future) career. The occupations on the specific occupation list based on your personality profile are examples of stereotypical occupations associated with the different personality types."		1	"2019-04-01 12:54:19"	"2019-04-01 12:54:19"
212	212	"However, the reality is that in practice, the boundaries between different personality types and three-letter codes are blurred and many occupations actually fit multiple personality types. For example, a surgeon must be able to communicate with people (social personality type), he/she must have an academic background (investigative personality type), like diversity in his/her work environment and needs to know how to operate medical equipment (realistic personality type). This example show that multiple personality types are present in one occupation."		1	"2019-04-01 12:54:19"	"2019-04-01 12:54:19"
213	213	"It is important for you to determine for yourself which of your characteristics, qualities and skills connect to the work areas that you want to be active in. If you are for instance a person who likes to work outside you should not look for work environments in which you work behind a desk all day on a computer. If you are an artistic person then it is advisable to choose an occupation in which personal interpretation, originality and creativity are encouraged and are appreciated."		1	"2019-04-01 12:54:20"	"2019-04-01 12:54:20"
214	214	"Furthermore, it can be done in different ways and does not necessarily have to be in an obvious work environment for a creative person like occupations as a writer or actor. Coming up with a new advertising campaign or a new product also requires a lot of creative insight and imagination."		1	"2019-04-01 12:54:20"	"2019-04-01 12:54:20"
215	215	"What you should also keep in consideration is the fact that a lot of people do not find all the characteristics, qualities and competencies that they find important in their work environment. For you it is important that you know who you are and know what you like."		1	"2019-04-01 12:54:20"	"2019-04-01 12:54:20"
216	216	"Also, you need to figure out where your personal skills, qualities and competencies come into their own. By doing so you can reflect on you work and make the adjustments in your career that you think you should make.
